# Optimizing-EV-Battery-Performance
 This project 					Successfully developed a machine learning-based system to predict the State of Health (SOH) of electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

Implemented and evaluated two powerful algorithms:

XGBoost and LightGBM

📊 Used real-world battery parameters as input features for model training and evaluation.

🎯 Both models showed high prediction accuracy, with XGBoost slightly outperforming LightGBM.

📈 Evaluated model performance using key metrics:

R² (Coefficient of Determination)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

⚙️ The system is capable of real-time SOH predictions, supporting:

Timely battery maintenance

Optimal replacement planning

📉 Helps EV users and manufacturers to make data-driven decisions to:

Extend battery life

Improve battery reliability

🌱 Demonstrates the effectiveness of predictive modeling in promoting sustainable electric mobility.
